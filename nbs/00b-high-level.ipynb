    "Classically you would start going through all the options. $0, 1, 2,$ etc. You will end up guessing $n$ times, where $n$ is the number of marbles in the vase. What if I told you that with a quantum algorithm we can guess the number of marbles with only $\\sqrt{n}$ guesses? That is if your friend is part of the quantum algorithm.\n",
