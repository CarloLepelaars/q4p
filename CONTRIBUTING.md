# Contributing

Thank you for considering to contribute to `q4p`! Here we provide some general guidelines to streamline the contribution process. The goal of this library is to provide comprehensive education for quantum computing. It mainly targets Python programmers and provides them with an accessible way to learn quantum computing.

## Before you start

- Fork [q4p](https://github.com/CarloLepelaars/q4p) from Github.

- install `q4p` in editable mode:

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -e .
```

## How you can contribute

We always welcome contributions to this repository. There are several aspects to this repository:

1. **Educational:** This consists of everything in the `nbs` folder except for the `9999-resources.ipynb` notebook. We always welcome corrections and improvements. In this case please create a Pull Request (PR) with your changes so we can review them. If you would like to contribute a major section or new notebook, please create a Github issue first so we can discuss the idea. 

2. **Resources:** This is the `nbs/resources.ipynb` notebook. Here we are trying to collect the best resources for learning quantum computing and exploring quantum mechanics. If you know of great resources that are not yet listed you can create a Pull Request (PR) with your changes. For resources we would like to focus on proper attribution and credit for original authors. We try to avoid plagiarized, artificially generated or rehashed resources. For book links we use Amazon affiliate links to support development of the project. The other resources are provided as is. 

3. **Repository Structure:** We always welcome ways to simplify and improve this Github repository. If you want to suggest corrections to `README.md`, redundant files or minor additions, please create a Pull Request (PR) with your changes so we can review them. If it is a major change like overhauling the dependency management, please create a Github issue first so we can discuss.

## PR submission guidelines

- Keep each PR focused. While it's more convenient, do not combine several unrelated contributions together. It can be a good idea to split contributions into multiple PRs.
- Do not turn an already submitted PR into your development playground. If after you submitted a pull request you discovered that more work is needed - close the PR, do the required work and then submit a new PR. Otherwise each of your commits requires attention from maintainers of the project.
